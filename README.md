# AGRISAGE
This project focuses on the development and implementation of a predictive model for crop selection based on a comprehensive agricultural dataset. The dataset comprises multiple features such as nutrients in soil, weather conditions, and other agronomic factors, with the target variable being the crop type.

The primary objective was to analyze the dataset to understand the key factors influencing crop selection, followed by the construction of a predictive model to recommend the most suitable crops for given conditions. Various data preprocessing techniques and exploratory data analysis (EDA) were employed to enhance the quality of the data.

Multiple machine learning algorithms were evaluated, including decision trees, random forests, and logistic regression, to determine the most accurate model. The final model was selected based on its accuracy.

Additionally, a Streamlit application was developed to provide an interactive user interface for stakeholders, enabling them to input specific agronomic conditions and receive crop recommendations with associated probabilities. This tool aims to support farmers and agricultural planners in making informed decisions to optimize crop yields and sustainability. Additionally, it ensures the validity of the model presented.
